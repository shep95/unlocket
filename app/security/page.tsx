            <h2>How releases are verified</h2>
            <p>
              Installers are served only from this site, over HTTPS. Each one has a SHA-256 listed on
              the <Link href="/download">download page</Link> and published beside it as{' '}
              <code>/downloads/&lt;file&gt;.sha256</code>. Check yours with{' '}
              <code>Get-FileHash</code> on Windows or <code>sha256sum</code> on Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
              noah updates itself from <code>/downloads/latest.json</code>, a manifest that names each
              installer with its address and SHA-256. The manifest is signed with noah&apos;s ed25519
              release key, which this site does not hold. noah checks the signature
              against the public key built into the app and refuses the update if it does not match,
              then checks the downloaded installer against its SHA-256 before installing it. Whoever
              controls this website alone cannot ship an update.
            </p>
            <p>
              The signature covers this text, with the asset lines sorted:{' '}
              <code>noah-release\n&lt;build&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;\n&lt;asset&gt; &lt;url&gt; &lt;sha256&gt;\n…</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Release public key (ed25519, hex): <code>{RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY}</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              The installers are not code-signed with an operating system certificate yet, so
              Windows SmartScreen does not recognise them. The SHA-256 is how you confirm a download
              by hand until they are.
