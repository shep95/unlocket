            <p>
              We do not own your projects, and we keep no records of them. We do not store your
              projects. We do not have access to your code, your files, or anything you create
              inside noah. Your work exists on your machine and nowhere else.

            <h2 className="text-text-primary font-medium mb-3 text-base">API models and your data</h2>
            <p className="mb-3">
              noah connects to AI models through your own API key — we do not hold a master
              key and we are not a middleman between you and the model provider. When you send a
              prompt, it goes from noah on your machine to the model provider directly (Venice AI,
              or whatever provider you configure).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              The models you connect may send your prompts and generated code back to their own
              infrastructure. We have no control over this. noah shows you which provider each
              model routes to so you can check that provider&apos;s data-and-prompt policy and make
              an informed choice before you type anything. Venice, for example, states it does not
              store prompts; other providers you add may differ — confirm with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not provide prompts to any model. We never inject our own prompts on your
              behalf, and we do not log or read your prompts. Your prompts are sent by noah to the
              model provider under your API key — they are yours from start to finish.

              Nothing identifiable. No account. No sign-up. No email. No analytics that can be
              traced back to you as an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pattern learning system that makes shepherd smarter over time runs entirely
              on your machine in noah&apos;s local storage. Those patterns are yours. They are never
              transmitted anywhere.

            <h2 className="text-text-primary font-medium mb-3 text-base">API keys</h2>
            <p>
              Your Venice API key and any other credentials are stored locally on your machine by
              noah. They are never sent to our servers. They go only to the services they belong to
              — Venice AI, and any provider you configure — when you perform an action that requires
              them. Do not share your machine or noah profile with people you would not share API
              keys with.

              accuracy, or fitness for any particular purpose. We are not liable for any
